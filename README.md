Scribbler
======

Scribbler allows you to make handwritten text from a typed in text by simulating your own handwriting. It takes the symbols that you have prepared beforehand in a vector graphical editor, and places them on a sheet, which you can then save and print. If you’re too lazy to create own font, you can use the default one.
