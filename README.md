Scribbler
======

Scribbler allows you to create handwritten text from a typed text by simulating your own handwriting. It takes the symbols that you have prepared beforehand in a vector graphical editor, and places them on a sheet, which you can then save and print. If you can not or do not want create your own font, you can use the default one. Also, Scribbler has a lot of output settings: size and orientation of the sheets, settings of margins and font, so you can set up it as you want.

It can be used to design invitations, greetings and inscriptions of celebrations. However, Scribbler is designed to generate large amounts of text, not only short inscriptions, so it can also be used for writing handwritten letters. Check it. =)
